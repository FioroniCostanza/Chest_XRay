# Classifying Chest X-Ray Images Using CNN Architectures
The project aims to harness the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images for various diseases. Utilizing advanced deep learning models, specifically DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, the project seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing chest-related diseases from X-ray images. These models are known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks. The project involves training and fine-tuning these models on a comprehensive dataset of chest X-ray images, aiming to establish a reliable, automated system for early and accurate disease detection in the medical imaging field.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is a comprehensive amalgamation of three distinct datasets from Kaggle, enriched to form a new dataset with 18 classes:
- **Chest X-ray – 17 Diseases**: This dataset includes X-rays in both JPEG and DCM formats, organized into 17 folders named after specific diseases or conditions [1].
- **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** Comprising 5863 X-ray images in JPEG format, this dataset categorizes images as either depicting pneumonia or being normal [2].
- **Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database** Contains chest X-ray images of normal individuals (3500) and patients diagnosed with Tuberculosis [3].

From these datasets, a novel dataset was curated, improving the scope of the project to encompass 18 disease categories.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes a range of technologies and tools for its implementation. Key technologies include:
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For building and training the CNN models.
- **Google Colab**: Used for leveraging GPU acceleration during model training.
- **Nvidia-smi library**: Employed to speed up the training process.
