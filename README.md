# Classifying Chest X-Ray Images Using CNN Architectures
The project aims to harness the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images for various diseases. Utilizing advanced deep learning models, specifically DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, the project seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing chest-related diseases from X-ray images. These models are known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks. The project involves training and fine-tuning these models on a comprehensive dataset of chest X-ray images, aiming to establish a reliable, automated system for early and accurate disease detection in the medical imaging field.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of 3 datasets from Kaggle platform:
- “Chest X-ray – 17 Diseases” [2], which including x- rays in 2 different formats JPEG and DCM and contains 17 folders corresponding to the name of the disease/condition.
- “Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)” [3] that contains 5863 x-ray images in JPEG format which are categorized as pneumonia or normal.
- “Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database” [4] contains CXR images of Normal (3500) and patients with TB.
